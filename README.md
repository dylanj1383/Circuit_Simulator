### Prerequisites
- Download and install processing from https://processing.org/download
 
### Usage
Run Circuit_Simulator.pde and use the GUI to build your circuits.

A power source for the circuit is already given.

Click on the buttons on screen or use keyboard shortcuts to place LEDs and switches.

Once you have placed a component, you can rotate, drag, or delete it with the buttons on screen or keyboard shortcuts.

Connect the components with wires by using the button or pressing 'w'. 
- Click to place a new wire point
- Eligible points for wire connections are shown with green circles on the components.
- You must start a wire at an eligible point but you can leave the other end free if you wish
- You can add to a wire by clicking on the free endpoint and placing more points
- Wires will snap to components

Once you have built your circuit, click the Run Button
- You cannot edit your circuit while it is running
- You can click on switches to toggle them on or off while the circuit runs
- If you create a short circuit, the battery will turn red
- LEDs will glow with appropriate brightness based on how you have wired your circuit
- Press stop to make changes to your circuit.

You are welcome to change any of the parameters at the start of the Circuit_Simulator.pde file.
